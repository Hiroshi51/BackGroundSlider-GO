# BackGroundSlider-GO

This is a simple BackGroundSlide jQuery Plug in.
You can modify this plugin flexbly. I especially reccoment that you use this to create a dynamic full page background.
please read the instruction below.

<h3>Step 1</h3>
prepare images named 
wall1.jpg
wall2.jpg
wall3.jpg
.
.
.
numbers at the ends must be serial. Not like 01,02,03 but 1,2,3,4.... Sorry a bit annoying though.

<h3>Step 2</h3>
in your html, between <head></head>, add the code below
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="backSlide.js"></script>
